# Find the square root of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the square root of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Assign number_iters = 100 in the function to perform 100 iteratios.
3. Set i = 0.
4. Calculate  number = 0.5 * (number + a / number) for 100 iterations.
5. Return number

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the square root for the given number(newton's method) using function.
Developed by: Yuvan M
RegisterNumber:  23002135
def gcd():
    n1,n2=int(input()),int(input())
    if n1>n2:
        smaller=n2
    else:
        smaller=n1
    for i in range(1,smaller+1):
        if(n1%i==0 and n2%i==0):
            hcf=i
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",hcf)
*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the square root for the given number(newton's method) using function is written and verified using python programming.
